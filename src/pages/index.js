            <p>
                I’m a software engineer, i’ve been in the tech industry for around 8 years. During all 
                those years i’ve built things mostly with html, css, javascript, php and golang in 
                fullstack and frontend positions.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Lately i’ve been more focused in the frontend side working with react, using functional
                programming techniques, writing unit tests and sometimes automating tasks with golang.
            </p>

                You’ll find more detailed information about my experience in my resume, also if you want 
                to get a sense of how i code there’s a github repository where you can see all the side 
                projects i’ve built, and the technologies i’ve worked with.
